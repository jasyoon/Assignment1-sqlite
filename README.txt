3. Other comments
    project requires students.csv file to run
    program should immediately start by showing menu 
    input a valid menu option to alter/view data
    quit the application by inputting 6 during the menu application


    issues:
    the way it is programmed, you can input empty fields. I couldn't think of a way to prevent this cleanly without absolutely flooding the code with the same check 
    so I just didn't account for it

    The inputs with strings are not validated as I couldn't think of a logical way to do so
