3. Extra comments

- searching students allows for using any combination of the queries. You can omit the ones you don't want by typing N/A for that query when prompted
- input validation for states, non 5 digit zipcodes, names, valid addresses, phone numbers not implemented as I couldn't figure out how
- on import, random advisors are applied to each student and appear when selecting option 1, but the changes do not actually show up in the database for some reason
- as with the input validation, forgot to add case when nothing is inputted. Kinda forgot and at this point am too lazy to add
